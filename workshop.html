			<h1>"The Engineering Academy is a premier programme to develop Engineering Innovators." <br>- SP Website</h1>
			<p>Engineering Academy gives me many opportunities to widen my skillset and explore limitless <br> boundries in expressing my creativity with well equipped FabLab facilities. </p>
			<p> <br>FabLab facilities gave me the opportunity to learn different crucial Engineering skills. <br>Example: 3D Printing Machines are readily available for me to 3D print designs I have made in <br> Fusion 360 using Ultimaker Cura. </p>

			<h1>Project 1:<br>Fusion 360</h1>
			<p>In Fusion 360, I created 3D design of a NameTag.</p>
			<p>Using Commands: Fillet to smoothen out the sharp egdes and making it rounder, <br>Creating a Sketch to be able to create a 2D design first,<br>Extrude to transform the 2D sketch into a 3D design, <br>Text to be able to type my name into the surface of the design and extruding <br>it afterwards to have my name appearing to Pop Out.</p>
			<p> <br> I also created a 3D design of a Queen Chesspiece.</p>

			<h1>Project 2:<br>Fusion 360 Exercises</h1>
			<p>Both exercises was honestly pretty standard.</p>
			<p>First step was to Create 2D sketches first and replicate the outline of the <br>object seen from a 2D perspective.</p>
			<p>Commands like Extrude allows the 2D sketch to be transformed to a 3D model. <br> It also acts as a Cutter and can form Cut-outs of shapes.</p>

			<h1>Project 3:<br>3D Printing</h1>
			<p>The 3D printer used is the Ultimaker. <br> In order to 3D print our Fusion 360 models, <br>it is required to convert the .F3D file into a .stl file first</p>
			<p>After it is done, Ultimaker Cura Application is required to be able for <br> modifications of the 3D print specifications</p>
			<p>For Example:</p>
			<p>Nozzle Size: The thinner it is, the more smooth the 3D print will be.</p>

			<h1>Project 4:<br>T-Shirt Design and Printing</h1>
			<p>I created a design of my shirt using Canva as it was very easy to use and does not require <br>download. <br> Exporting it in SVG format whuch makes use of Vectors makes the image quality <br>much more sharper than PNG format.</p>
			<p>I've always been fascinated with Space and Pirates <br> so I decided to blend both elements into one with the Pirate logo and <br>Spaceship <br>to make it look super SICK.</p>
			<p>At first, I was really nervous about the process of heating my <br>shirt as it is dangerous but <br>the Seniors were really friendly making the process less intense.</p>
			<p>First step was to iron the shirt for 5 seconds to <br> make sure there are no wrinkles.</p>
			<p>After that I had to paste the printed designs that was <br> printed using a special <br> kind of INK paper at the <br> shirt.</p>
			<p>With that comes the final heating process which takes 45 seconds.</p>
